                                        <li>India ranks among the best in terms of finding technological solutions in agriculture. But, it’s a matter of regret when we see our agriculturists struggling to provide two meals for their children. India’s varied geographic and demographic conditions has restricted us to adapt to the technological advancements in agriculture. Our rural economy still stands as a limiting factor for our development index. Our primary survey* revealed that every year about 95-110 farmers commit suicide in village with a population of 2144. It is a very intense problem which cannot easily be imagined by urban youth unless we go visualize the situation. Crop failure stands as major reason for the farmer suicides. Even with government spending 4 lakh crore ** on agro research every year our agriculturists still continue to practice age old traditional method of cropping that is eventually leading them to unsustainability. As we see lot of Agri-tech enterprises blossoming, they find a hard road in expanding their service region. There is no roof that integrates all the Agri-innovators to provide a comprehensive solution for the agriculturists.</li><br>
                                        <li>We are a team of young social entrepreneurs ready to tackle these challenges. We see this to be a great opportunity to address the issue with our strategies, management propositions, technical micro-innovations, sustainable agricultural techniques and integrating them with traditional knowledge and field expertise.</li><br>

                                        <li>Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia, a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of dementia cases</li><br>
                                        <li>Alzheimer's has no current cure, but treatments for symptoms are available and research continues. Although current Alzheimer's treatments cannot stop Alzheimer's from progressing, they can temporarily slow the worsening of dementia symptoms and improve quality of life for those with Alzheimer's and their caregivers. Today, there is a worldwide effort under way to find better ways to treat the disease, delay its onset, and prevent it from developing.</li><br>
                                        <li>We are a team of motivated individuals to help Alzheimer’s patients by stopping the progression of dementia. In year 2018, an average of 48,000$ is spent just for the care of Alzheimer’s patients. We aim to bring smiles in more Alzheimer’s affected families.</li><br>
                                        <li>It was the year 2017 when my grandmother who was 80years old then was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Dementia. This was the turning point in my life.  When I began to visit the care homes, I realised the scale at while this disease has spread. </li><br>
                                        <li>My Team and I have come up with an Artificial Intelligent application which triggers the patients with memories in an immersive way. </li><br>
                                        <li>We are currently working with the National Health Services, UK for testing our product in the CCG’s. We are encouraged and backed by renowned doctors and consultants. </li><br>
                                        <li>We dream of bringing smiles on Alzheimer’s affected families by stopping the progression of the disease and effectively saving billions of rupees that is spent on taking care of the Alzheimer’s patients.</li>
